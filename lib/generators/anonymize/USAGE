Description:
    This generator creates a migration to anonymize a model's fields.
    If the generator is used to generate migration for a model with field "name",
    it will create a migration to create a new field "anonymized_name"

Example:
    bin/rails generate anonymize Model field1 field2

    This will create:
        db/migrate/20160101000000_anonymize_model.rb
